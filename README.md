This program consists of three components:
  - A master which consolidates orchestrator statistics from various clients
    - Converts raw results of grpc calls into prometheus data points
    - TODO integration with email / telegram
    - TODO api to subscribe for notifications and cancel it
    - TODO read test stream scores
    - TODO allow custom names (configure via frontend, ENS done)
  - A client which pushes stats to master
    - Gets the list of active Orchestrators from the Livepeer subgraph
    - Does GetOrchestrator calls to all Orchestrators one by one
  - A frontend where users can (un)subscribe to notifications
